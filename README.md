# CSOPESY-CPU-SCHEDULING CSOPESY - S11

A CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulation

This repository contains a Python program that simulates basic CPU scheduling algorithms, including FCFS, SJF, SRTF, and RR. 

## Files

### `algorithm_functions.py`

This file contains the implementation of the algorithms used in the project.

### `main.py`

The main entry point of the project. It orchestrates the execution of the algorithms and manages the user interface.

### `process.py`

This file defines the `Process` class, which represents processes with attributes like name, arrival time, and burst time.

### `utils.py`

A collection of utility functions for handling user inputs, displaying information, and other helper tasks.
